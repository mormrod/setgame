# Overview
SetGame is a simple Javascript representation of a similar card game called "Set".  I do not own the Copyright on the original and I just present this code purely for demonstration and non-profit purposes.  The aim is to make the code as light as possible using a combination of tools including Gulp, script concatenation, SASS, browserify, and Bower and NPM package managers.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo.
2. Run "bower install" at the root.
3. Run "npm install" at the root.

## Running
1. Run "gulp" at the root, and it will build all of the code into a new subfolder "/public".
2. Setup your webhost with "public" as the root folder.
3. Go to your webhost, and it will open "index.html"

## Changelog

* 1.0 - Created and committed initial working version of the application
